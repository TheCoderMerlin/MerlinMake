# This script generates the command line required to use the proper version of merlin libraries both for
# compiling a project and for executing the project.  The command is then executed.

# The sole argument is either 'debug' or 'release' depending on configuration.
# If no argument is specified defaults to 'debug'.

# The file must either be named make.sh or use a symlink named run.sh
# The filename is then detected; make.sh will build while run.sh will run.

# Dynamic library dependencies are specified in the file 'dylib.manifest' located in the same directory
# as make.sh.
# There are two line formats:
# project version -OR-
# project LOCAL path
#
# The second format facilitates simple development of libraries by easily allowing a local directory
# as a source.
