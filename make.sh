# This script is generally included as a submodule within a Swift project
# located (from the project root) at ./MerlinMake/make.sh
# It generates and executes the command line required to use the
# proper version of merlin libraries based upon a file named 'dylib.manifest'
# which must be located in the project root if dynamic libraries are required.
# If the file does not exist, no error occurs, and the commandline will be
# generated without referencing any dynamic libraries.
# The project root is the same location as .git and Package.swift (if required).

# Arguments:
# --mode='build'|'run'|'list-dylib-paths', default is 'build', short key is -m
# --configuration='debug'|'release', default is 'debug', short key -s -c

# Dynamic library dependencies are specified in the file 'dylib.manifest' located in the same directory
# as make.sh.
# There are two line formats:
# project version -OR-
# project LOCAL path
#
# The second format facilitates simple development of libraries by easily allowing a local directory
# as a source.
# For example:
# Igis		LOCAL		/home/john-williams/projects/Igis
# Scenes	0.1.8
